Two fonts obtained from historical 8 bit video game
fonts.

The game in question is Samurai Shodown(sic).   The
company owning the rights to the fonts went bankrupt,
and it is unclear who owns the rights to the font.

I am considering using them to develop tools and learn
about fonts as "fair use".    There is an new company
with the same name now formed.   I will try to contact
them to see if they could provide us rights to the fonts
as part of sponsorship.
