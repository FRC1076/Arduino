#  Quotes from "2001: A Space Odyssey"  - contributed by Matthew
I’m sorry, Dave.   I’m afraid I can’t do that.
I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
I know that you and FTA were planning to disconnect me. And I'm afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.

# Lyrics from "Space Oddity"
I'm stepping through the door And I'm floating in a most peculiar way And the stars look very different today
For here Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world Planet Earth is blue And there's nothing I can do

# Robot lines adapted from "A Princess Bride"
True love is the best thing in the world, except for fresh batteries.
Never go in against a Samurai when Worlds is on the line.
I do not mean to pry, but you don’t by any chance happen to have six wheels on your right side?
Enough about my beauty. Everybody always talks about how beautiful I am. I've got software. Talk about that.
